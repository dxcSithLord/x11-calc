## x11-calc - Another RPN (Reverse Polish) calculator.

Written in C using X11. Work in progress, currently just a 'nice' GUI,  with

The  intention is for the code to be reasonably portable.  Currently it will
compiles  and run on Linux using x64, arm, and i386 processors and VMS using
both VAX and Alpha processors.

## To Do

* Sort out colour mapping to allow program to run on display with less  than
  24 -bit colour - may get round to this be one day...
* Rewite the display code in a more structured form (like the button and LED
  segment code).

* Everything else!

## Later
